a master document for the smash bros. series, written in .tex

if you wish to contribute to writing, put yourself under \author{} by doing an \and separator from the last author!

ideally this could be a collaborative effort, but will be quite distinct from something like the smashwiki, as subjective opinions or historical artifacts (like matchup charts) may be encouraged to include.
