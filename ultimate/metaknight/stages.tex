\subsubsection{Stages} \label{ult-metaknight-stages}

\paragraph{Yoshi's Story}
Possibly the most banned stage (in Europe) against Meta Knight, alongside Battlefield, due to the top platform.

Meta Knight's fullhop reaches the side platforms after \textbf{1 step} from the ledge. Essentially, anywhere that is not exactly at the ledge will result in landing on the platform with a fullhop.

\subparagraph{Condor Dive Setup}
To do a \textit{Condor Dive} on this stage, you should position yourself on the innermost part of the side platform, input \textit{Drill Rush} while standing and proceed to hold down until you expect to grab ledge.
