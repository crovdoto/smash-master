	\emph{(Rapid Jab Finish)}

While generally unsafe, Meta Knight's \emph{rapid jab} has notable strength in dealing shield pressure, either by the edge of a platform or by crossing up shields using the lengthy skid animation. If it does hit, it may deal up to $20.1\%$. The move does not fill the typical role of a jab, which would be relegated to his \textit{down tilt}, instead.

An excellent poking tool. With a 3-frame startup and a $25\%$ chance to trip, Meta Knight's \emph{down tilt} serves as the perfect jab for the character, letting him jab-lock or set up for a combo-starter such as a grab or \textit{dash attack}.

Often revered as one of the best (combo-starting) dash attacks in the game, Meta Knight's \emph{dash attack} is one of, if not the most important, moves in his toolkit. The variable angles it can send at set up for various \textit{up air} strings. The downside of this move is that it scales somewhat fast. It ceases to be an effective combo-starter at early-mid percentages, but does not become a potent KO-threat until much later percentages.

Nonetheless, this move is fundamental to Meta Knight's combo game, is hard to react-DI, and always provides at least \textbf{8 frames} of hit advantage.
