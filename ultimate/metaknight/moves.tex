	\emph{(Rapid Jab Finish)}
\end{center}

While generally unsafe, Meta Knight's \emph{rapid jab} has notable strength in dealing shield pressure, either by the edge of a platform or by crossing up shields using the lengthy skid animation. If it does hit, it may deal up to $20.1\%$. The move does not fill the typical role of a jab, which would be relegated to his \textit{down tilt}, instead.

		Startup	& Endlag & Total & BKB & KBG & Trip\\

\end{center}
An excellent poking tool. With a 3-frame startup and a $25\%$ chance to trip, Meta Knight's \emph{down tilt} serves as the perfect jab for the character, letting him jab-lock or set up for a combo-starter such as a grab or \textit{dash attack}.

		Startup	& Endlag & Total & BKB & KBG & Angle \\

Often revered as one of the best (combo-starting) dash attacks in the game, Meta Knight's \emph{dash attack} is one of, if not the most important, moves in his toolkit. The variable angles it can send at set up for various \textit{up air} strings. The downside of this move is that it scales somewhat fast. It ceases to be an effective combo-starter at early-mid percentages, but does not become a potent KO-threat until much later percentages.

Nonetheless, this move is fundamental to Meta Knight's combo game, is hard to react-DI, and always provides at least \textbf{8 frames} of hit advantage.

\paragraph{Up Air}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| c  c  c | c  c  c | c  c |}

		Startup	& Endlag & Total & BKB & KBG & Angle &	Landing Lag	&	Shield Stun	\\
		6	&	20	&	26	&	65	&	128 & 	67\deg	&	9 	&	3	\\

The essential move for Meta Knight's ladder combos, as well  being an important aspect of his bridges and stage-carries. While its hitboxes are lacklustre, and the move does not come out as fast as in Brawl, and is certainly out-shined by other up-aerials in Ultimate. In order for ladders to be true, you need to deal 26 frames of hitstun, so that \textit{up air} strings into \emph{up air}. This threshold is approximately $0.236/w$, where $w$ is the opponent's weight:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c c c c |}
	\hline
	\textbf{Character} & Pichu & Mario & Bowser	\\
	\hline
	$w$		&	62		&	98		&	135		\\
	$\%$	&	17.4	&	22.2	&	27.1	\\
	$\%/w$	&	.281	&	.227	&	.200	\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The usual strategy with \textit{up air ladders} is to keep going until it starts sending into tumble, to then finish the opponent off with \textit{shuttle loop}.


\paragraph{Forward Smash}
% TODO: fsmash frame data
Due to its absurd shield safety and low endlag, \textit{f-smash} is one of Meta Knight's best grounded neutral options. A potent KO-threat at mid-high percentages that functions greatly as a conditioning tool. After hitting a shield, Meta Knight may throw out a \textit{d-smash} to cover for certain out-of-shield options (e.g. grabs, shield-drops).

\paragraph{Down Smash}
% TODO: dsmash frame data
The fastest \textit{d-smash} in the game. An excellent ``get off of me!'' option. The unorthodox hitbox shape makes it difficult to hit at times, particularly if you seek to use it as a finisher to your combos, but its speed makes it reliable in what it can do.
