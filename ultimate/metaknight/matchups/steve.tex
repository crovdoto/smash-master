\paragraph{Steve}

It might be important for Meta Knights to know how to play against Steve.

\subparagraph{Interactions}

Steve's \textbf{Minecart} is one of his most annoying moves. Against riding cart, \textit{Mach Tornado} and \textit{Nair} often beat out, or at least, tend to trade with it. \textit{Dsmash} will always beat it out, but requires somewhat tight timing.

Since \textit{minecart} has variable damage depending on its velocity, it can be tough to gauge. But if we assume it to always be \textit{around} 20\%, then all we need to know is that if our damage would exceed 11\%, then it should at least clank.
